    "# N-Gram Language Models (basic)\n",
    "\n",
    "A n-gram language model is a type of statistical language model that predicts the likelihood of a sequence of words based on the probability of occurrence of smaller word sequences called n-grams. An n-gram is a contiguous sequence of n items from a given sample of text, where the items can be words, characters, or even phonemes. In the context of language modeling, an n-gram typically refers to a sequence of n words. For example, in the sentence \"I love to play soccer,\" the 2-grams (or bigrams) would be \"I love,\" \"love to,\" \"to play,\" and \"play soccer.\" The 3-grams (or trigrams) would be \"I love to,\" \"love to play,\" and \"to play soccer.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The n-gram language model makes assumptions about the probability of a word occurring based on the previous n-1 words. It utilizes a training corpus of text to calculate the frequencies of n-grams and estimates the probability of encountering a particular word given the preceding n-1 words. This probability can be computed using the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(w_n|w_{1:n-1}) = \\frac{Count(w_{1:n-1}w_n)}{\\sum_{w}Count(w_{1:n-1}w)} = \\frac{Count(w_{1:n})}{Count(w_{1:n-1})}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $w_{1:n}$ are all the words in a sequence up the word $w_n$ at position $n$, and $w_{1:n-1}$ are all the words in a sequence before the word $w_n$ at position $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The n-gram model is a simplified approach to language modeling and is based on the Markov assumption, which assumes that the probability of a word only depends on a fixed number of preceding words. For example, if we only consider the $k=2$ words before the word $w_n$, then our probability formula becomes\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(w_n|w_{1:n-1}) = P(w_n|w_{n-k:n-1})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $w_{n-k:n-1}$ are the $k$ words ahead of word $w_n$ in the sequence. While it has limitations in capturing long-range dependencies and context, n-gram models are computationally efficient and widely used in various natural language processing tasks such as speech recognition, machine translation, and text generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook covers the very basic idea behind n-gram language models. To this end, we implement the toy example from the lecture. The goal here is to show that training an n-Gram language model really just boils down to going through a text and counting the occurrences of n-grams for using Maximum Likelihood Estimation to compute the conditional probabilities. Of course, in practice, things can quickly become more complicated when (advanced) smoothing techniques are considered. But even then, the underlying requirement is counting the occurrences of n-gram. We use simple Add-k Smoothing to give an example for a smoothing technique -- compared to, e.g., Kneser-Ney Smoothing.\n"

Given the toy example containing only 3 sentences without punctuation marks, hyphenated words, abbreviations, or anything else that would make tokenization in any sense challenging, using spaCy is kind of overkill. However, this makes it easy to extend the corpus with your own sentences without worrying about the correct tokenization."

    "\n",
    "Training a n-gram language model is all about keeping counts of all n-grams found in a text. Here, we do this on a sentence-by-sentence basis. The method `process_sentence` below takes a sentence `s` and the current n-gram counts, goes through all n-grams in the sentence, and updates the n-gram counts accordingly. We also keep track of the vocabulary as we need the size of the vocabulary for smoothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we use a `defaultdict` instead of a standard dictionary here. This is purely for convenience, since we don't need to check if a key (i.e., a n-gram) is already present in the dictionary before updating the count. This just saves a couple of lines of code. We also only consider bigram and trigram language models. Again, this is purely to make the code as compact and easy to read as possible -- this is not a principle limitation!"
